Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset (Reviews.csv). The main goal is to preprocess, clean, and build machine learning / deep learning models to classify reviews based on their sentiment.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
ðŸ“Š Dataset
File: Reviews.csv
Columns:
- Id â†’ Review ID
- ProductId â†’ Unique product identifier
- UserId â†’ Reviewerâ€™s ID
- ProfileName â†’ Reviewerâ€™s name
- HelpfulnessNumerator / HelpfulnessDenominator â†’ Helpfulness score
- Score â†’ Rating (1â€“5 stars)
- Time â†’ Timestamp of review
- Summary â†’ Short text summary of review
ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
1. Removed missing values and duplicates
2. Converted timestamps to readable dates
3. Lowercased and tokenized text data
4. Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters
ðŸ¤– Models Used
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Naive Bayes
- LSTM / RNN (Deep Learning)
- Transformers (BERT-based, optional)
ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve
ðŸ“Œ Results
- Logistic Regression baseline achieved ~XX% accuracy
- Deep Learning models improved results significantly
ðŸ”® Future Work
- Improve preprocessing with lemmatization/stemming
- Try advanced transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT)
- Deploy as a web app (Flask / FastAPI + Streamlit for UI)
